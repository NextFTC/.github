# NextFTC
This GitHub organization is home to a few different projects, including our flagship library, [NextFTC](https://github.com/NextFTC/NextFTC)!

NextFTC is a simple but powerful library for [FTC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc), a middle and high-school robotics program.

Take a look at the NextFTC Docs at [nextftc.dev](https://nextftc.dev/), or join the Discord server with [this invite](https://discord.gg/PjP9Ze6fkX).
